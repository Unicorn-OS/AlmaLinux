# origins:
>"In December 2020, Red Hat unilaterally terminated CentOS development[15][16][17][18] in favor of CentOS Stream, a distribution positioned upstream of RHEL.[19] In response, one of the CentOS founders (Gregory Kurtzer) created the Rocky Linux project as a successor to the original mission of CentOS.[20] In March 2021, Cloud Linux (makers of CloudLinux OS) released a new RHEL derivative called AlmaLinux." â€” [wiki/CentOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS)
